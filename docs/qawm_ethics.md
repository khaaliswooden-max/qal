# QAWM Ethics & Guardrails

## 1. The Ethical Landscape

Quantum Archeology grants the power to reconstruct the lives of the dead and the secrets of the past. This power carries immense responsibility.

### Risks

- **Epistemic Injustice**: Misrepresenting marginalized groups due to biased traces.
- **Privacy of the Dead**: Revealing secrets that were meant to stay buried.
- **Political Misuse**: Weaponizing history to justify modern atrocities.
- **Overconfidence**: Presenting speculative models as absolute truth.

## 2. QAL Ethical Guardrail Principles

1. **Transparency of Inference**: Every claim must be tagged with a confidence level (VERIFIED, PLAUSIBLE, SPECULATIVE).
2. **Multiplicity of Sources**: No reconstruction should rely on a single trace type. Triangulation is mandatory.
3. **Respect for the Dead**: Reconstructions of individuals should be handled with dignity. Avoid unnecessary exposure of private suffering.
4. **Anti-Fabrication**: The model must never "hallucinate" evidence. Gaps must be explicitly rendered as gaps (voids), not filled with convenient fiction.
5. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Error bars and probability cones must be visible in all outputs.
6. **Cultural Sensitivity**: When reconstructing cultural artifacts, consult descendant communities where possible.
7. **Alignment with Flourishing**: The ultimate goal of reconstruction is to understand the human/planetary condition to foster long-term flourishing, not to settle petty scores.

## 3. Implementation in QAL

- **Governance Agents**: Automated agents that review queries for ethical violations.
- **Audit Logs**: All reconstructions are logged with the parameters and data sources used.
- **Watermarking**: All QAWM outputs are cryptographically signed to prevent deep-fake history.
