# Critical Success Factors

## 6.1 What Will Make This Work

* **Epistemic Rigor**: Never compromise on uncertainty quantification. A system that admits "I don't know" is more trustworthy than one that fabricates confidence.
* **Interdisciplinary Integration**: QAWM spans physics, biology, history, computer science. Build bridges between domains; respect domain expertise.
* **Ethical Non-Negotiables**: The 10 principles are not optional features. They are foundational constraints. Violating them destroys legitimacy.
* **Computational Scalability**: Real-world reconstructions will involve millions of traces, thousands of entities, complex causal graphs. Optimize early.
* **User Trust**: Historians and scientists will only adopt QAWM if it's transparent, correctable, and respects their expertise. Build for collaboration, not replacement.

## 6.2 What Will Make This Fail

* **Overconfidence**: Presenting speculative reconstructions as verified facts.
* **Black-Box Reasoning**: Opaque inference pipelines that experts can't audit.
* **Cultural Insensitivity**: Offending communities whose pasts are being reconstructed.
* **Computational Intractability**: System takes weeks to answer simple queries.
* **Brittleness**: System breaks when encountering unexpected trace types.
