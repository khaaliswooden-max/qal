# QAWM Open Research Questions

## Theoretical Physics & Information Theory

1. **The Decoherence Horizon**: What is the theoretical hard limit on information recovery from a macroscopic system after $t$ time?
2. **Quantum Erasure in History**: Can we mathematically distinguish between information that is scrambled vs. information that is truly erased?
3. **Retro-causality Artifacts**: How do we handle "future" traces (e.g., simulations) that influence "past" reconstructions in a loopy causal model?

## Computational Archeology

4. **Missing Data Imputation**: What are the best ML architectures for filling in massive gaps in historical datasets without hallucination?
5. **Multi-Modal Alignment**: How do we align a geological timescale (millions of years) with a tweet-storm timescale (seconds) in a single model?
6. **Simulation Fidelity**: How much compute is required to simulate a Bronze Age city at the level of individual agents?

## Ethics & Governance

7. **The Right to be Forgotten**: Do past entities have a right to privacy from future reconstruction?
8. **Algorithmic Bias in Reconstruction**: How do we detect if our models are projecting 21st-century values onto 1st-century agents?
9. **Consensus Mechanisms**: How do we resolve conflicting reconstructions generated by different agents?

## System Architecture

10. **Storage of Probabilistic Histories**: How do we efficiently store a world model that is a superposition of 1000 plausible histories?
