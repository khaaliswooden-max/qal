# Quantum Archeology Labs (QAL)

> **Quantum Archeological World Model (QAWM) — v1.0**

Welcome to the **Quantum Archeology Labs (QAL)** repository. This codebase serves as the computational substrate for **Quantum Archeology**—the scientific reconstruction of past states of complex systems using present-day traces, information theory, and multi-layer causal inference.

## 🌌 What is QAWM?

The **Quantum Archeological World Model (QAWM)** is a first-principles framework designed to reconstruct history from the "noise" of the present. It treats history not as a linear narrative, but as a probabilistic distribution of past states recovered from entropic traces.

**[Read the Concept Map](docs/qawm_concept_map.md)** for a deep dive into the theory.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following modules:

- **`/docs`**: Core documentation and theoretical frameworks.
  - [Concept Map](docs/qawm_concept_map.md): Definitions and axioms.
  - [User Playbook](docs/qawm_playbook.md): Guide to using QAWM and QAWM-QL.
  - [Ethics & Guardrails](docs/qawm_ethics.md): Principles for responsible reconstruction.
  - [Research Questions](docs/qawm_research.md): Open problems in the field.
- **`/schemas`**: Machine-readable definitions.
  - [Unified Schema](schemas/qawm_schema.json): JSON schema for Entities, Events, and Relations.
- **`/examples`**: Reference implementations.
  - [Case Studies](examples/qawm_examples.md): Human, Non-Human, and Hybrid reconstructions.
- **`/traces`**: (Data) Raw and normalized information substrates.
- **`/worldmodels`**: (Storage) Probabilistic models of past states.
- **`/reasoners`**: (Logic) Causal inference engines and temporal solvers.
- **`/agents`**: (AI) Autonomous archeologists and governance bots.
- **`/ui`**: (Interface) CLI and visualization tools.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Understand the Theory

Start with the **[Concept Map](docs/qawm_concept_map.md)** to understand the physics and information theory behind the model.

### 2. Learn the Language

Review the **[User Playbook](docs/qawm_playbook.md)** to learn **QAWM-QL**, the query language for requesting reconstructions.

```yaml
RECONSTRUCT:
  system: "Late 21st Century Internet"
  scope: L3_TECHNO_ECONOMIC
  timescale: { start: "2080", end: "2100" }
  output: NARRATIVE
```

### 3. Explore Examples

See the **[Examples Library](examples/qawm_examples.md)** for concrete applications, from the Bronze Age Collapse to AI Alignment scenarios.

For detailed, step-by-step reconstruction processes, refer to the **[Example Workflows](examples/workflows.md)**.

## ⚖️ Ethics

Quantum Archeology is a powerful tool. All usage must adhere to the **[Ethical Guardrails](docs/qawm_ethics.md)**, prioritizing:

- Transparency of Inference (Verified vs. Plausible vs. Speculative)
- Respect for the Dead
- Anti-Fabrication
